# Fractal Engine

Created by Leo McCarthy-Kennedy

This project is the implementation of the raymarching rendering technique in the Unity engine. Two example scenes are included in the project to demonstrate the engine's capability.

NOTE: Loading a scene for the first time will require the HLSL shaders to compile. Depending on your hardware, this can take a while (5+ minutes).

This project would not have been possible without the help of numerous public resources and open source projects. The following resources were critical in the development and success of this project:
